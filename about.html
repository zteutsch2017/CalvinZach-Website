		Call me Ishmael. Some years ago-never mind how
		long precisely-having little or no money in my purse,
		and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I
		would sail about a little and see the watery part of the
		world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and
		regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself
		growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp,
		drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself
		involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and
		bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially
		whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it
		requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from
		deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically
		knocking people's hats off-then, I account it high time to
		get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol
		and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself
		upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is
		nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all
		men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very
		nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.

	THE MICE summoned a council to decide how they might best devise means of warning themselves of the approach of their great enemy the Cat. Among the many plans suggested, the one that found most favor was the proposal to tie a bell to the neck of the Cat, so that the Mice, being warned by the sound of the tinkling, might run away and hide themselves in their holes at his approach. But when the Mice further debated who among them should thus "bell the Cat," there was no one found to do it.

	<br>
	<br>

	THE WEASELS and the Mice waged a perpetual war with each other, in which much blood was shed. The Weasels were always the victors. The Mice thought that the cause of their frequent defeats was that they had no leaders set apart from the general army to command them, and that they were exposed to dangers from lack of discipline. They therefore chose as leaders Mice that were most renowned for their family descent, strength, and counsel, as well as those most noted for their courage in the fight, so that they might be better marshaled in battle array and formed into troops, regiments, and battalions. When all this was done, and the army disciplined, and the herald Mouse had duly proclaimed war by challenging the Weasels, the newly chosen generals bound their heads with straws, that they might be more conspicuous to all their troops. Scarcely had the battle begun, when a great rout overwhelmed the Mice, who scampered off as fast as they could to their holes. The generals, not being able to get in on account of the ornaments on their heads, were all captured and eaten by the Weasels.

	The naive one once asked, "But sir, why don't we make the rollercoasters out of wood?" 
	<br>
	<br>
	The wise one stood and thought for a long moment.
	<br>
	He did not have an answer for such a simple question.
	<br>
	<br>
	Baffled... he grasped for a solution and suddenly the reality of the question struck the wise one.
	<br>
	<br>
	"Well, my young friend, the rollercoaster could never be constructed of wood, for the tension in the system equals zero."

		<li> THROUGH me you pass into the city of woe:	
		Through me you pass into eternal pain:	
		Through me among the people lost for aye </li>

		<li> All hope abandon, ye who enter here.	
  		Such characters, in color dim, I mark'd	        
		Over a portal's lofty arch inscribed.</li>

		<li> With hands together smote that swell'd the sounds,	
		Made up a tumult, that forever whirls	
		Round through that air with solid darkness stain'd,	
		Like to the sand that in the whirlwind flies.</li>

		<li> They envy. Fame of them the world hath none,	
		Nor suffers; Mercy and Justice scorn them both.	
		Speak not of them, but look, and pass them by.</li>

		<li>Comes on an old man, hoary white with eld,	
		Crying, "Woe to you, wicked spirits! hope not	
		Ever to see the sky again. I come	
		To take you to the other shore across </li>

		<li> Around whose eyes glared wheeling flames. Meanwhile	
		Those spirits, faint and naked, color changed,	
		And gnash'd their teeth, soon as the cruel words</li>

		<li> E'en in like manner Adam's evil brood	
		Cast themselves, one by one, down from the shore,	
		Each at a beck, as falcon at his call.</li>
